## Overview

This project showcases the **design and output** of an AI-driven system built to analyze visual banner layouts and promotional changes across retail homepages over time.

The system automates the process of:
- Capturing historical homepage snapshots
- Analyzing visual banner content using AI
- Structuring unstructured visual data
- Detecting and classifying layout or promotional changes

This repository is intended as a **high-level demonstration** of the project’s concept, workflow, and outputs.

## Problem Statement

Retail and telecom homepages change frequently, making manual tracking of:
- Hero banners
- Promotional messaging
- Layout positioning

time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent.

This project addresses that problem by introducing a **repeatable, automated, AI-powered visual analysis pipeline**.

---

## What the System Does

- Retrieves historical homepage snapshots using web archival sources
- Generates full-page screenshots via browser automation
- Applies AI-based computer vision to extract:
  - Hero banners
  - Promotional headlines and subheadlines
  - Banner positioning
- Produces structured, time-based analytical outputs
- Detects whether a page has:
  - No change
  - First-fold changes
  - Promotional/deals section changes
  - Multiple layout changes

---

## Design Highlights

- **Retail-agnostic architecture**  
  The system is configurable across multiple retail websites by changing the target URL.
  
- **AI-assisted visual intelligence**  
  Converts raw screenshots into structured, analyzable data.

- **Change-focused analysis**  
  Emphasizes detecting *meaningful* visual and promotional updates rather than raw pixel changes.

---

## Sample Output

This repository includes a **sample analysis output** to demonstrate what the system produces.

📄 `sample_output_verizon_ai_analysis.csv`

The file contains:
- Timestamped homepage snapshots
- Extracted banner headlines and subheadlines
- Structured classification of change types across dates

This sample is provided **only for demonstration purposes**.

---

## Code Availability

The full implementation (automation scripts, AI integration, and processing logic) is maintained in a **private repository** to protect intellectual ownership.

> Code access can be shared upon request for review or discussion.
